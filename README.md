## Features

- **Serverless**: Using Zeit Now for deployment you can get your GraphQL API deployed in seconds. Zero maintenance and low cost. 🚀
- **Typesafe**: Typescript allows you to write better code faster. On top of that, due to the nature of graphql, all your query types can be generated as easily as `npx apollo client:codegen` for use on your favourite frontend tech stack. 🛡
- **Stateless**: Using the JWT allows for a stateless system, no need to keep track of session ids and the like on Redis, or on your database. Sweeeeeet 🍭
- **Easily extensible**: As a boilerplate Saas-GraphQL, provides the boring, annoying setup to get your saas started. Things like Accounts, Users, Authentication and Authorization. Leaving space for your customisations 👷
- **(Almost) 0 config**: The only things you need to do is provide your JWT token secret and your mongodb URI 🙀

## Quickstart
- Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/davodesign84/saas-graphql` and `cd aas-graphql`
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Install Zeit now, instructions can be found [here](https://zeit.co/download).
- add your `DATABASE_URI`  (for the mongodb connection) and `SECRET` (for the JWT generation) secrets to a `.env` file in your root folder
- Generate the token secret [here](https://mkjwk.org/) and add it to Now `now secret add SECRET <your token secret>`
- Add your mongodb URI `now secret add DATABASE_URI <your token secret>`
- Run dev `now dev` and open `localhost:3000`
- the schema can be explored on the right end side of the Graphql playground


Enjoy! You just saved a couple of days of faffing around with boring stuff 🤴
